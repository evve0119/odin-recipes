    <h3>
        San bei ji, also called three cup chicken, is a beloved recipe for chicken that's braised in equal parts soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice wine. The sauce has a sweet kick from a little white sugar and plenty of texture from the crispy Thai basil leaves.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>½ cup sesame oil</li>
        <li>10 slices fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup dry sherry</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
        <li>½ cup fresh Thai basil leaves</li>
        <li>3 dried whole red chilies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in the same skillet. Add ginger and garlic; cook and stir until ginger begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved chicken, sherry, soy sauce, water, and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until there is only 1/4 cup of liquid left in the skillet, about 20 minutes. Stir in basil and chiles; increase heat to medium and continue cooking until liquid is almost gone.</li>
